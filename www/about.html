        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>This server is built entirely on Go's <code>net</code> package. It opens a raw TCP listener, accepts connections, and handles each one in its own goroutine.</p>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>A TCP listener binds to port 8080</li>
            <li>Incoming connections are accepted in a loop</li>
            <li>Each connection is handled concurrently in a goroutine</li>
            <li>Raw bytes are read until the end-of-headers marker (<code>\r\n\r\n</code>)</li>
            <li>The request line and headers are parsed manually</li>
            <li>The requested file is loaded from disk and served with the correct content type</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>This project demonstrates how HTTP works under the hood. By skipping Go's built-in <code>net/http</code> server, every part of the protocol is handled explicitly &mdash; from parsing request lines to formatting response headers.</p>
